# Caucasian and Chinese Brain Templates [US200 CN200]
We use a diffeomorphic template building framework (ANTs) to create Caucasian (US200) and Chinese (CN200) brain templates based on high-quality T1 weighted MR images from HCP and CHCP datasets aged 19 to 37 years. The Caucasian and Chinese templates include brain/head templates and tissue probability templates.
